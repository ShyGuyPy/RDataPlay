this is just a place for me to play with and learn R markdown.

note: working in python requires that you install the 
reticulate package:
package.install('reticulate') ...in R console


the following section of python code writes a function that prints only the odd numbers in a given list

```{python}
my_list =  [3,8,5,7,12]
another_list = [3,4,6,1]

def find_odd_num(the_list):
  for i in the_list:
      if i % 2 != 0:
          print(i)
  print(" ")
          
find_odd_num(my_list)
find_odd_num(another_list)
```

this section of R code will print hello world and then sum 10 and 13
```{r}
print("hello world")
sum_this <- function(x,y) {
  final.scalar <- x + y
  return(final.scalar)
}
sum_this(10,3)
```
